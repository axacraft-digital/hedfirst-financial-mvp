## MAPPING TO OUR 9 INPUT VARIABLES

### Direct Mappings
1. **Customer Acquisition Cost** → CAC benchmark ($195 default)
2. **Monthly Churn Rate** → Annual rates / 12 (1.8% monthly average)
3. **Average Revenue Per User** → AOV × Transaction Frequency
4. **Monthly User Growth Rate** → Stage-appropriate growth rates

### Derived Calculations
5. **Consultation Fee** → Derived from industry standard $75-$120/visit
6. **Prescription Margin** → 15-25% markup on wholesale costs
7. **Operating Expense Ratio** → 65-75% of revenue (industry standard)
8. **Marketing Spend Ratio** → 15-25% of revenue for growth stage
9. **Monthly Active Users** → Growth rate compounding from base

## SCENARIO PLANNING

### Conservative Case (25th percentile)
- Higher CAC, higher churn, lower utilization
- Use for worst-case runway calculations
- Attractive to risk-averse investors

### Moderate Case (50th percentile) 
- Industry median performance
- Primary case for VC presentations
- Balanced growth assumptions

### Aggressive Case (75th percentile)
- Best-in-class metrics
- Use for upside scenario modeling
- Demonstrates market opportunity

## VC PRESENTATION NOTES

**Key Talking Points**:
- Our blended CAC target of $195 is 22% below industry average
- Chronic care focus drives 45% lower churn than primary care pure-plays
- Dual revenue model creates 2.3x higher ARPU than consultation-only platforms

**Benchmark Sources for Credibility**:
- Public company earnings (Teladoc, Amwell, Veracyte)
- McKinsey Digital Health Report 2024
